# Golang Fundamentals

The presentation is in **go present** format (https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/tools/present)

Students can install **go present** in order to view the presentation, or you can host it locally in your own repo and let them access it on the web at https://talks.godoc.org/github.com/your-repo

Solutions are included, but of course feel free to write your own. It's best to live code the solutions while the students are writing their own solutions.
